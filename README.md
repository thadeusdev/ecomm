## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Ruby 3.0+
- Rails 7.x
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecomm.git
   cd ecomm
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

### Database Setup

1. **Set up PostgreSQL:**
   - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create the database and run migrations:
     ```bash
     bin/rails db:create
     bin/rails db:migrate
     ```

2. **Seed the database** (optional):
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:seed
   ```

### Stripe Setup

1. **Edit Rails credentials** to store your Stripe API keys securely:
   ```bash
   EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
   ```

   This will open the credentials file in VSCode (or your preferred editor). Add your Stripe keys in the following format:
   ```yaml
   stripe:
     secret_key: your_stripe_secret_key
     public_key: your_stripe_public_key
   ```

2. Once the keys are added and saved, Rails will securely manage them using encrypted credentials.

## Usage

1. **Run the Rails server:**
   ```bash
   rails s
   ```

2. **Navigate to the app in your browser:**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/admin` to see the application in action.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - You can sign up or log in to manage your account.
   - Admin users can manage products and orders.

4. **Checkout:**
   - Add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.
   - Complete the transaction through Stripeâ€™s secure payment gateway.
